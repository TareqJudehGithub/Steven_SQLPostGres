Database Design process
 - What kind of thing are we storing? (table name)
 - What properties does this thing have? (column)
 - What type of data does each of those properties contain? (column data types)


Table
 - A table stores a collection of records that all have a related meaning.
 - A table is a collection of columns and rows related to the table.

Columns
 - Columns are the table headers (properties).

Rows 
 - Rows are the data stored and related to each column.
 

Example of an SQL statement:
CREATE TABLE cities (
	name VARCHAR(50),
  country VARCHAR(50),
  population INTEGER,
  area INTEGER
);

  Keyword
   - Tell the database that we want to do something. Always written out in capital 
     letters. (CREATE, INSERT INTO, SELECT) are some of keywords examples we usually
     use writing SQL statements.

  Identifier
   - Tell the database what thing we want to act on. Always written out in lower case
     letters. Table names, columns name, and also rows name are all examples of SQL 
     Identifiers.


Columns data types
  VARCHAR(50)
   - A string character.
   - 50 means we are not expected to store a character longer than 50 character long.

  INTEGER
   -  A number without decimals, ranging from - 2 billions to positive 2 billions.
